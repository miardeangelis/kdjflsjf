Ive now got dyspepsia in that diabolical thing that Carlyle calls the stomach, rushed and caught train Bought a New York World at Elizabeth for my mental breakfast Among the million of perfected Mortals on Manhattan island two of them took it into their heads to cut their naval chord from mother earth and be born into a new world, while two other less developed citizens stopped two of the neighbors from living The details of these two little

incidents conveyed to my mind what beautiful creatures we [liv?] live among, and how with the aid of the police, civilization so rapidly advances Went to New York via Desbrosses Street ferry tooks car across town saw a women get into car that was so tall and frightfully thin as well as dried up that my mechanical mind at once conceived the idea that it would be the proper thing to run a lancet into her arm and knew joints and insert automatic self feeding oil cups to diminish the creaking when she walked Got off at Broadway tried experiment of walking two miles to our office at 65 5th Ave with idea it would alleviate my dyspeptic pains It didnt Went into Scribner & Sons on way up saw about a thousand books I wanted right off Mind No 1 said why not buy a box full and send to Boston now Mind No 2 (acquired and worldly mind) gave a most withering mental glance at mind No 1 and said You fool, buy only two books, these you can carry without trouble and will last until you get to Boston.
